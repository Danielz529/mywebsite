:::{#me}

Hello, and thank you for visiting my personal website. I'm Daniel Lopez, a dynamic professional with a passion for business economics, data analytics, and fostering diversity and inclusion. Let me give you a glimpse into my academic and professional journey.

As a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate holder, my dynamic background includes serving as a Student Assistant at UCSD's Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, where I actively contributed to ongoing diversity research projects. Simultaneously, I thrived as a Small Business Owner in San Francisco, managing an e-commerce venture with a 75% increase in profit margins. Proficient in programming languages like Java and Python, along with data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau, I offer a versatile skill set. Bilingual in English and Spanish, I am well-equipped to connect with diverse audiences, making a meaningful impact in any professional setting.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my journey, projects, and the value I bring to any team or project. Connect with me on LinkedIn, I'm excited about the possibilities, and I look forward to connecting with you!
